# Liver Disease Classification

## Objective
This project aims to predict the onset of disease using different Supervised Learning algorithms.

## Data
The data for this project was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jeevannagaraj/indian-liver-patient-dataset). Moreover, The "Dataset" column in the dataframe is a *class label* used to identify whether a person has liver disease or not.
